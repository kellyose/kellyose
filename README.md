Stroke Prediction
📋 Overview
This project aims to build a predictive model for stroke detection using machine learning techniques. By analyzing health-related data, the model predicts the likelihood of a stroke occurrence, helping healthcare professionals identify at-risk patients and take preventive measures.

🚀 Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encodes categorical data, and normalizes numerical features.
Imbalanced Data Handling: Uses techniques like SMOTE to manage class imbalance.
Model Evaluation: Compares multiple models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Linear Discriminant Analysis) using ROC-AUC as the evaluation metric.
Pipeline Automation: Implements an end-to-end pipeline for data transformation, oversampling, and model training.
Best Model Selection: Saves the best-performing model using pickle for future use.
